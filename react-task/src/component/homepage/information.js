        React is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Why do we
        care about React? React is a popular, easy to learn tool, that’s
        designed to work everywhere. With some basic web development skills like
        JavaScript, HMTL, and CSS, you can build professional looking, slick UIs
        quickly and easily. React is built to work across browsers, operating
        systems, and devices. So this React intro article should be worth your
        time development skills you can learn once, code anywhere. This article
        assumes you’re somewhat familiar with web development concepts. It has a
        basic overview of web development, reasons why React is great to learn,
        how to build a React code snippet, and an overview of syntax basics.
        These tech stacks that developers use to build web applications are
        often called Web Frameworks or Web Application Frameworks. React.js is a
        modern framework for JavaScript. Adding React to the basic
        HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack makes it a lot easier to make more robust user
        interfaces.

        To understand GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git. Git
        is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus
        Torvalds—the same person who created Linux. Git is similar to other
        version control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.
        So, Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? When
        developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant
        changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first
        official (non-beta) release. Version control systems keep these
        revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository.
        This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new
        version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision.
        Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and
        contribute. We’ve established that Git is a version control system,
        similar but better than the many alternatives available. So, what makes
        GitHub so special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around
        which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com—where
        developers store their projects and network with like minded people.
        Let’s go over a few of the main reasons that geeks like to use GitHub,
        and learn some terminology along the way.

        PHP is a general-purpose scripting language especially suited to web
        development.It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer
        Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994.The PHP reference implementation is now produced
        by The PHP Group.PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,but it now
        stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.PHP code
        is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as
        a module, a daemon or as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On
        a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code which
        may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data –
        would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template
        systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist which
        can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that
        response. Additionally, PHP can be used for many programming tasks
        outside of the web context, such as standalone graphical applications
        and robotic drone control. Arbitrary PHP code can also be interpreted
        and executed via command-line interface (CLI). The standard PHP
        interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under
        the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most
        web servers on almost every operating system and platform, free of
        charge.

        Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for
        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted
        by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting
        languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a
        web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page
        semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
        document. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
        constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
        embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
        headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML
        elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation
        of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
        separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility
        and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable
        multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in
        a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the
        structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to
        improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and
        its formatting. Separation of formatting and content also makes it
        feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for
        different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
        speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
        devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
        accessed on a mobile device.
